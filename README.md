## Talks üë®‚Äçüè´

#### Monologue for the Cloud

**Presentation**: [Monologue for the Cloud](https://github.com/danielamariei/talks/tree/master/monologue-for-the-cloud)

The purpose of this presentation is to introduce the concept of Cloud computing. In order to accomplish this, we structured the presentation as follows:
* **Main characteristics**: In this section, we describe the main characteristics that Cloud computing exhibits.
* **Architecture and service models**: This section provides details regarding the architecture of the Cloud, together with the stack of service models.
* **Advantages. Disadvantages**: In this section, we present the duality between the advantages and disadvantages of Cloud computing.
* **Cloud providers**: We enumerate some of the most popular Cloud computing platforms. We conclude with a description of OpenStack, an open-source Cloud computing platform.
* **Do we use the Cloud?**: In the final part of the presentation, we conclude with a description of several popular freely available web applications that are empowered by the Cloud.

#### Natural/unconventional interfaces and game resurrection

**Presentation**: [Natural/unconventional interfaces and game resurrection](https://github.com/danielamariei/talks/tree/master/natural-unconventional-interfaces-and-game-resurrection)

The purpose of this presentation is twofold. Firstly, we explore unconventional user interfaces (e.g. haptic, speech, olfactory, etc.) which become an increasingly prevalent mode of interaction. Secondly, we describe an open-source game (i.e. TeTwix, Website: https://github.com/danielamariei/tetwix) which proposes a modern version of the classical electronic game Tetris by adopting these new user interaction techniques.

* **Nontraditional interfaces**: In this section of the presentation, we expose the main characteristics for each interaction method, as well as the general context which enables them to be used as a day-to-day technology. Several examples are also included.
* **Tetris GamR (Game Resurrection)**: We describe the main aspects of our developed game. As the game proposes a modern version of Tetris, it supports multiplayer game modes, while user(s) are able to use natural I/O devices and interaction methods such as: gestural (Leap Motion), locomotion (Makey Makey), etc. The game is attractive for various population segments and can be used as a means for having fun or to carry out cardio exercises, a serious game, and many others.
