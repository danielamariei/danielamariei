### Movie Recommendation
**GitHub repo**: https://github.com/danielamariei/movie-recommendations

The implementation of a movie recommendation system on top of the Hadoop platform using Apache Pig and Apache Hive. 

The purpose of this project is to provide movie recommendations based on the ratings made be multiple users. It uses a collaborative filtering algorithm in order to construct user profiles, detect the closest users and construct a set of movies that the users will most likey appreciate. The algorithm is based on the work presented in the following book (chapter 9): Title: Minning of Massive Datasets, Authors: Jure Leskovec, Anand Rajaraman and Jeffrey D, Ullman.
 
 Input:
 - a CSV file with user ratings that has the following columns at least:userId, movieId and rating,
 - a CSV file with movie data that has the following columns at least: movieId and movieTitle,
 - the id of the user for which we want to make the recommendations, 
 - the size of the sample from the ratings file on which we should base our algorithm.
  
 Output:
 - a list of recommended movie titles.

**Tech: Hadoop, Apache Pig, Apache Hive, Python**

### Natural/unconventional interfaces and game resurrection

**Presentation**: [Natural/unconventional interfaces and game resurrection](https://github.com/danielamariei/talks/tree/master/natural-unconventional-interfaces-and-game-resurrection)

The purpose of this presentation is twofold. Firstly, we explore unconventional user interfaces (e.g. haptic, speech, olfactory, etc.) which become an increasingly prevalent mode of interaction. Secondly, we describe an open-source game (i.e. TeTwix, Website: https://github.com/danielamariei/tetwix) which proposes a modern version of the classical electronic game Tetris by adopting these new user interaction techniques.

* **Nontraditional interfaces**: In this section of the presentation, we expose the main characteristics for each interaction method, as well as the general context which enables them to be used as a day-to-day technology. Several examples are also included.
* **Tetris GamR (Game Resurrection)**: We describe the main aspects of our developed game. As the game proposes a modern version of Tetris, it supports multiplayer game modes, while user(s) are able to use natural I/O devices and interaction methods such as: gestural (Leap Motion), locomotion (Makey Makey), etc. The game is attractive for various population segments and can be used as a means for having fun or to carry out cardio exercises, a serious game, and many others.

### Insufficient Process Validation

**Presentation**: [Insufficent Process Validation](https://github.com/danielamariei/talks/tree/master/insufficient-process-validation)


The purpose of this talk is to cover how `Insufficient Process Validation` occurs when a Web Application fails to prevent an attacker from circumventing the intended flow or business logic of the application [1]. For example, if the user state through a process is not sufficiently well verified, the Web Site is vulnerable to exploitation or fraud.

We cover practical examples that depict `Insuficient Process Validation` situations:
* `best-buy`: Entering negative values on donation forms.
* `list`: Listing directories without beeing authenticated.
* `youtube`: Accessing restricted content.

### SQL Injection Tools: Pangoling and sqlmap

**Presentation**: [SQL Injection Tools: Pangoling and sqlmap](https://github.com/danielamariei/talks/tree/master/pangoling-and-sqlmap)

The presentation introduce the following SQL Injection Tools: Pangolin and sqlmap. These are penetration testing tools that automate the process of detecting and exploiting SQL Injection vulnerabilities. Pangolin is a penetration testing, SQL Injection test tool for database security. Its main purpose is to detect and exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities. Following the detection of SQL Injection vulnerabilities, the users have available a plethora of options to choose their further exploration, including: 
* perform a DBMS fingerprint; 
* retrieve DBMS session user and database;
* enumerate users, password hashes, privileges, databases, etc.;
* run specific SQL statements;
* etc.
